DATA1200 Home-Exam Autumn 2024
Members: Jakub Wegrzyn, Alperen Saka, William Aasvold, Guleed Abdullah, Joel Mako

We were tasked to create a website, based on the OsloMet-MatMod site, with 4 pages (Home page, Accessibility, GitHub and Activity Page) where all pages had to share the same menu and css sheet.
We chose to re-design the page and make it more appealing to the eye, hence why we chose the monochromatic blues color palette and a simplified structure of the website whilst keeping the same information.
This included a navbar, som different headers, tables (both ordered and unordered), the use of flexboxes, some images and correct sectioning, as well as some buttons and a footer.

We have a well commented code, with citing of "copied" code if used. A list of contents at the top of the CSS as well as some headings for the different classes and what they do.
The website is compatible with portait mode, regular 16:9 and wide 21:9.
We also made a "sketch" of the website using canva.com which is linked at the bottom.

Random (but cool) Info:
Palette choice: Monochromatic blues (Hex codes: dark blue #023E8A, medium blue #0077B6, light blue #90E0EF, pale blue #CAF0F8, gray-blue #CFE6FF)
